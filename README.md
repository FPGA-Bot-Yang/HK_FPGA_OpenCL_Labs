# HK_FPGA_OpenCL_Labs

This project is based on the work from Gopalakrishna Hegde, Nachiappan Ramasamy, Nachiket Kapre - reference: https://github.com/nachiket/papaa-opencl

This repository supports the Heterogeneous Accelerator Summer School 2018 held at Hong Kong University July 2018.

  1, Labs/ contains the set of labs targeting the Arria 10 device using Intel's OpenCL SDK v17.1. The labs mainly focus on 2D convolution and explore effects of datapath optimization, memory optimization and compute unit parallelization.

  2, docs/ contains a set of PDFs for Intel/Altera OpenCL optimization guides.
